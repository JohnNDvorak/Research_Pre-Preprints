# Pre-Preprints Repository

This repository contains draft research papers shared **prior** to formal submission to arXiv.

## What Are "Pre-Preprints"?

These are early, in-progress versions of my research papers. I'm sharing them openly for:
- Rapid idea dissemination
- Early feedback from colleagues
- Collaboration opportunities
- Transparency in my research process

**⚠️ Important:** These are *unreviewed drafts* that will contain errors, incomplete sections, and will change significantly before final submission.

## Repository Structure



Each paper is organized in its own folder: `YYYY_LastName_ShortTitle/`

## How to Cite

**Before arXiv:** Please treat these as *personal communication* or cite as:

> Dvorak, J. N. (2025). *Paper Title*. Pre-preprint. GitHub Repository. URL

**After arXiv:** Always cite the arXiv version instead (links added to `/submitted/` folder).

## Disclaimer

These drafts have not undergone peer review or institutional approval. They may contain mistakes, incomplete citations, and provisional data. Do not distribute without checking for the latest version. All ideas and results are provisional.

## Feedback Welcome

- **Typos/Minor issues:** Open a GitHub issue or PR
- **Substantive feedback:** Email me directly at `john.n.dvorak@gmail.com`
- **General discussion:** Use the paper's issue tracker
